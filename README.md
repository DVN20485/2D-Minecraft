The 2D Minecraft project will be used in machine learning. This 2D simplified version is more suitable for Machine Learning agents since it is more lightweight as it does not require all the graphics and it will be written in Python rather than Java. 

In this game you can move your character around using WASD keys, and you can destroy material blocks such as trees, stones etc. And craft tools and items at the crafting table using the materials that you have collected in your inventory. Specific tools will be required to destroy certain material blocks.
